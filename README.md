# Poppy

Poppy is not a native mobile application but a hybrid application, a web application catered for mobile built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Bootstrap's 12-grid system is used to assure responsive design across devices. [Adobe PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) was used to access Poppy on mobile devices. PhoneGap's native plugins to access the device's camera, file system, and storage were used as well.

Poppy is a mobile application that keeps a digital copy of all your paper receipts. The idea of Poppy roots from a personal struggle of mine, where I tend to hoard countless number of receipts, with the fear that I'll need one of them one day. This mobile application allows the user to take a photo of their receipts, categorize them by vendor name and date, and simply store them on the application. Later on, the user can easily retrieve them by its chronological order.
